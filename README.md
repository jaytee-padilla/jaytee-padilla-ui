# jaytee-padilla-ui
A marketing website I created in one week for an application called Reading Recommender. The app asks the user a handful of questions and recommends a book based on the data collected.

I collaborated with a project lead, a back end developer, an iOS developer, 2 front end architects, 2 data scientists, and 2 other UI Developers to make this project happen. I was one of 3 UI Developers tasked with creating the marketing website and this is my personal instance of the project (the other UI developers made their own designs).
